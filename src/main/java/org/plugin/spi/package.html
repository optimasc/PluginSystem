<p>Generic interfaces that may be implemented by service provider interfaces.</p> 

<p>Both the {@link org.plugin.spi.Codec} and {@link org.plugin.spi.ContentConverter} interfaces
represent possible Service Provider interfaces that may be implemented to convert data from
one format to another. </p>

<h2>Error management</h2>

<p>Service Providers should throw the {@link org.plugin.ServiceProviderException} exception in case
of error to be consistent.</p>

<p>The following sections presents different use cases and how they can be implemented with
the service providers.</p>

<h2>Configurable service providers</h2>

<p>When service providers need to be configured, the {@link org.plugin.spi.ServiceConfiguration} interface
should be implemented, as it will permit to have a generic way to present configuration information
to the user in a user interface. </p>

<h2>Service provider information</h2>

<p>Service providers should implement the {@link org.plugin.spi.ServiceMetadata} interface if they will
be managed and loaded dynamically, as it permits to return information on the service provider implementation. 
The returned information may be retrieved by the <code>MANIFEST.MF file</code> of the service provider JAR file.</p>

<h2>Initialization / Finalization</h2>

<p>Service providers that require initialization and finazilation code and which are loaded dynamically should
implement the {@link org.plugin.spi.RegisterableService} interface. Higher-level callers to the service
providers should also call the methods in that interface if available once before usage of the service and
before shutdown of the service.</p>


<h2>Service Provider activation / deactivation (Java SE/Android only)</h2>

<p>In the case where service providers may be activated or deactivated at runtime, the following, refer
to the {@link org.plugin} package.</p>

<h2>Input / Output types</h2>

<p>Service providers that have generic {@link java.lang.Object} inputs and outputs should implement the
{@link org.plugin.spi.InputOutputTypeProvider} interface to give information on the class information
that is accepted as input and outputs.</p>

<h2>Format types</h2>

<p>Service providers that can convert from one format to another, such as video codecs should implement the 
{@link org.plugin.spi.FormatProvider} interface to be able to return the types of supported formats, and
to optionally configure the format to be used when doing conversion.</p>
